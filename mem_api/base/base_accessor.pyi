    Base class for all accessors.

    An accessor is a class that provides an interface to a specific system or resource, such as a database or a file system.
    It is responsible for connecting to the system, managing the connection, and providing methods for interacting with it.

    Accessors are designed to be used by multiple components within the application, and should be treated as a black box by other components.
    They should not be instantiated directly by components, but rather through the application's dependency injection container.

    Attributes:
        logger (logging.Logger): The logger for the accessor.
        app (core.components.Application): The application instance.
